# SpicyClient - The open source hypixel client
Spicy is an open source Minecraft client that I create in my free time, you are free to reference and copy my code. There are two reasons why made it open source, The first one is that protecting the jar is annoying and the second is that I want people to be able to reference code whenever they need to. If you find any bugs or a hack is not currently bypassing then feel free to contact me. If you have any code that you want added to the client then you may also contact me

# Most problems can be solved on the [wiki](https://github.com/NathanKassab/SpicyClient/wiki)

## How to modify the code
Coming soon

## Exporting the client into a jar
