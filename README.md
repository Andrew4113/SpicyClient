# (READ) This is an outdated guide, It will be updated later

## Introduction

> The point of SpicyClient is to allow people to create a Minecraft client without starting from scratch

## How to modify the code

> To get started with the source code just download the newest source code from https://SpicyClient.info and run it, then all you have to do is to go to the src folder and replace the Minecraft folder with the Minecraft folder on github, then open eclipse and select the eclipse folder as your workspace. if no projects show up just create a new one and name is Client with a capital c and then you should see the the source code. Sometimes not all of the libraries will be found, if this happens to you just go to your build path and set the library's location's again.

## Exporting your client

> To export your code just build your code in eclipse and open the jar file in winar, then download the built SpicyClient jar file from https://SpicyClient.info and open it in winrar. then replace the net and info.spicyclient packages in the SpicyClient jar with the ones from the jar you created, after all that you should be able to run your code in the Minecraft launcher.
